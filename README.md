# image-classification-keras

"Hello world project" to learn TensorFlow. I made and trained a simple 4-layer Neural Network on the NMIST dataset obtaining a validation accuracy of 0.975. Apart from the NN I developed some utility features including:
* A dataset visualizer.
* All misclassified images are saved.
* A bar graph displaying frequency of error per symbol
* An overfitting plot (accuracy vs validation accuracy)

# What I learned

* The basics of Tensorflow
* Using Keras to streamline the NN building and training process.
